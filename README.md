**Last week we had a healthy discussion on Communications Surveillance setup. Following are the summary points from the meeting:**

• Using existing system, not building new one
• Same login, separate work areas  
• Communications gets own database + storage
• Market team unchanged
• Waiting for Stephen's compliance check
• Technical approach confirmed by architect and Databricks expert
• Same resource group - no new infrastructure needed
• Batch data processing from Surveil-X exports
• Schema-level separation approved for access control

**Need information and follow up on:**
1) **Database** - Create communications_surveillance schema in existing SQL server
2) **Permissions** - Set up Databricks user groups for team separation  
3) **Timeline** - 6-week implementation once compliance cleared
4) **Missing items** - Speech Services cleanup, landing zone verification, updated architecture diagram

**Next steps:** Waiting for Stephen's compliance update, then begin Phase 1 implementation (SQL schema + storage containers).
